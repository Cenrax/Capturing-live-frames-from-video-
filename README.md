# Capturing-live-frames-from-video-
It is used to capture frames from a live streaming at a particular frames per second (fps).
It has an ample application in medical-devices where we can capture live images from USG videos or MRI Scans.

Run the **code.py** and change the path of the frames as per your requirement.

**Note** *The processor of the system comes into action if you try to capture frames at a very high fps*
